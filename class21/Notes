whats super keyword;
super keyword in Java is used to refer to the parent class object;
why should we learn super keyword.
  1)if we have same name variable or methods in the super/parent/base class then we
  can use the super keyword to refer to parent class variable or method because by
  default java prefers the variables of child class. We can also call the super class
  constructor with the help of super with parenthesis super();
how to use super keyword:
1)We can use method name or field name to call the method or to access the
field of super class.
2)use the super with paranthesis to call the super class constructor

Rules;
10we can only access the immediate parent class constructor or field or method
with the help of super keyword.
2)when can only use super() inside a constructor.
3)If we have a user created constructor in the parent class we must have a matching parameter
constructor inside the child class as well.
4)super() should  be the first line inside a constructor
5)If we have multiple constructor inside the parent as soon as one is match we are to go
we don't need to match each and every constructor from the parent

What is MethodOverLoading
  When same name method exist in a class but with different number of parameters or
  different type of parameters or different of parameters it is called
  MethodOverLoading.
  Why we should use MethodOverLoading:
  1)Makes you code more readable.
  2)Makes the life of the end user easy they don't have to memorize many method names.

  How we can use method overLoading:
  we can have same name method but we have to follow the below rules.
  1)by passing different number of parameters.
  2)we can change the datatype of parameters
  3)we can also overload a method by changing the sequence of parameters
