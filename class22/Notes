 what MethodOverloading in Java.
 with the help of method overloading we can have many methods with same name but
 different parameters in a class.
 Why we should use MethodOverLoading
 1)Cleaner code if multiple methods are doing the same thing we don't need to come
 up with different names;
 2)Flexibility for the end user;
 How we can use methodoverloading in Java
   we can overload a method by changing three things.
   1)Number of parameters;
   2)change the data type of parameter
   3) we can change the sequence of parameters.
   class calculator{

   int method(int num1,int num2){
   return num1+num2
}
int method(int num1,int num2,int sum3){
   return num1+num2+num3;
   }


   Rules;
   1)method should be same but parameters should be different
   2)we can't overload a method by just changing its return type
   3)we can also over load constructor by following the same rules
=======================================================================
what is MethodOverriding:
Happens when same method exists inside the parent class and the child class.
Why we should override a method:
  If we are inheriting from parent class and we don't like thr implementation
  of a method from the parent class we can provide our own implementation.
  Sometimes done to improve the performance of code.
  How we can override a method'
  when we inherit from a class we just need to write that method inside the child class.
  all should be same except the body and access modifier.
  Rules:
  1) for override we must inherit from a class.
  2)the method in the parent class that we want to override must be exactly the same
  as method in the child class only the access modifiers can be different
  3)The access modifiers in the parent class can only be increased with respect to the
  visibility for example we can change default to protected or to public but we can't make
  it private
  4)if something is not inherited we can't override it for example private methods and constructor
