      constructor:
Constructor is a block of code that is used to constructor object.
            Why we should use Constructor
constructor help us initialize object in cleaner ad more readable  way.
They are better than methods because they are called automatically when we create an object.
Most of time fields are privet and because of this reason we cant access them outside the class
which they are and cant initialize them
         How to use Constructor
  We create the constructor by writing a block of code that has same name as class name.
  When we create the object of the class it is called automatically
     Rules;
     1)Constructor don't have return tipy not even void
     2)
     Constructor should have same name as class name
     3)constructor can have access modifiers like privet public and protected
     4)constructor cant have non access modifiers like static final synchronized
     5)Default constructor  is provided by java if we don't write on
     6)When we create the object of a class then a constructor is called.for example
     if the class name is Dog Dog dog1=new Dog();
     7)We can create multiple Constructor to give the other user flexibility that
     they don't have to provide all the values to all the instance fields when creating n object of
     you class.
     8)We can call the constructor fo a class by using this keyword with parenthesis.
     this() we can pass parameters and java will decide based on these parameters which constructor
     to call.
     "this" keyword:
     When ever we can same name variables as instance variable and local variable this keyword can
     help up resolve the conflict between local and instance variable.
     Class Human{
     String name="sleeping Zombi";

     void printName():
     String name ="wake up Zombi";
     System.out.println(name);

what is inheritance;
inheritance is a mechanism in java through which we can get the properties and methods
from the parent class inside the child class
Why we should use inheritance
  Inheritance helps us reduce the amount og code that we have to write for exampel if there are some
  properties ant methods which are present in many class we can created a parent class for all of those
  properties and can put the common properties or method inside that parent class and can make children classes
  extend from that parent clas.
  How we can use inharince;
  1(Create a parent class
  2)pull all the common methods and properties from children classes inside that parent class.
  3)use extends keyword to inherit from that parent class.

  Types of inheritance:

  Rules:
  1)Private fields and private methods cant be inherited inside the children classes
  2)constructors are also not inherited
  3)
