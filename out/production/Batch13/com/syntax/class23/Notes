what is method overriding in Java:
When same method with same header exists in the child class as well we call it method
overriding.
Why we should override a method:
if wwe inherit from the class all the methods which are not private the are inherited
 in the child class if we don't like some of these methods may because the consume more
 internet bandwidth or consume a lot of CPU or uses a lot of memory we can override them
 the child class

How  can we use method Overriding;
 1) we must first inherit from the a class;
  2) we can redeclare the method with same header and provide the body of our choice.

  Example:
  class Parent{


  void eat(){

  System.out.println("I Like to eat Beef")
}
void sleep(){
System.out.println("I like to sleep 8 hours a day")
}
}
class Child extends{

void eat(){
System.out.println("I like to eat Mutton")
}


Rules;
  1) we must a super class derived class relationship
   2)method in the parent and child class must have same headers but they can be
   different in terms of access modifiers and in very rear conditions in terms of return
type;
3) we can't change the access modifiers from public to protected or default but we can
do it in reverse order;
4)we can't  override constructor because they are also not inherited;
5) If a method is static we use a different terminology it is called method redeclaration
instead of overriding
