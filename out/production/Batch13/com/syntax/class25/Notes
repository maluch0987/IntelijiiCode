What is abstraction:
Abstraction is the process of hiding the inplemintation details and only showing the functionality
.its the 3rd pilar of OOp;
Why we should use abstraction:
1)It reduces the complexity by separating the ideas from implementation.
2)We can enforce rules on other class.
How we can the use abstraction:
we can use abstraction our code with help of abstractet classes and intertaces
we create abstract with only the header and mark the class as abstract now every
class that will be inheriting from this class will either implement those methods or
mark the child class abstract as well.
Rules:
1)Abstract methods cant have a body;
2)As soon as we have one abstract methods in a class that class must be declared as abstract
3)once a classes inherit from a abstract class that class must implement the abstract methods
or it should be marked as abstract
4)we can have normal methods with body and abstract methods inside a class
5)We can't create the object of abstract classes.
6)abstract classes can't be declared final classes;
7)We CAN have everything inside an abstract class that we can have in a normal
class only thing that differs is we can't create the object of that class
