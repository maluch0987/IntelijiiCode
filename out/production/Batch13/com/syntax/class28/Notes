What is a list;

List is an interface inside the collections framework Which have below properties
1)Insertion order is maintained.
2) I can store duplicate data
List is implemented by name classes but we will be focusing on ArrayList and LinkedList:
ArrayList:
  when my requirement is that i will be reading the data a lot then i should be going
  with ArrayList.
  LinkedList:
  most of our operation will be writing the data to a list in between or in the start
  or shifting the data we should be going with LinkedList
Iterator:
is an interface that has three methods hasNext(),next(),and remove(),
whenever we try to modify the size of a list using simple loop there are chances that it
will not work or will throw an error because lists are dynamic and can change the size at runtime
so to be always in the safe side we should use Iterators
=================================================================================
         Set:
1)Duplicate are not allowed
We will be discussing three types of sets:
1)HashSet
2)LinkedHashSet
3)treeSet
             HashSet:
No insertion order is maintained but it is the fastest of all
LinkedHashSet:
Upside:
 Insertion order is maintained
 DownSide:
 retrieval of element will be super super slow
 insertion sped slower than HashSet:

 TreeSet:
 UpSide:
 Element will always be in sorted from
 DownSide:
 insertion speed is slowest of all
 Retrievel speed better than LinkedList but slower than HashSet
=======================================================================
Map:
Map is an interface in java that allow us store key value pairs
we cant have duplicate keys but we can have duplicate values
We will be discussing three of them
1(HashMap
2)LinkedHashmap
3)TreeMap
Upside:
Fastest when it comes to insert and retrieve the element
DownSide
No insertion order

LinkedHashMap
Upside Insertion order will be maintained
DownSide Retrieve will be slowest
TreeMap
UpSide;
data will be store in the sorted form based on key
DownSide;insertion is the slowest
