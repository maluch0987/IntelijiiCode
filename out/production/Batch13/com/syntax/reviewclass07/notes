Types of variables in Java;
We have three types of variables;
1)Local variables--
are variables that we declare inside a block of code
They occupy the memory for shortes period of time
downSide:They cant by accessed out side of the block in which they are declared
2)Instance variables:
Are the variables that are declared inside a class but outside of a block code
upSide:Can be accessed in all  the methods of class.The can have different value for
instance of the class
3)Static variables;
  All the variables which are defined outside a block of code witch static keyword they
  are called static variables;
  upSide:
  they only reserve a single memory location for all the instance of a class
they can be accessed by just writing the name of the clASS and variable name
downSide:
The occupy the memory for the longest period of the time always store only one value
for all the object of the class
Real life use:
Most of the time you will be storing contacts values in static variables.
static is also heavily methods that don't involve instance variables.
Access modifiers:
There are 3 access modifier keyword(privet,protected,public) and 4 access levels in
 Java(privet,default,protected,public)

 Rules:
 Access modifiers can only be used witch instance and static members of the
 class (fields and methods
 privet:
    When we use privet with any method or variable we can only access that method or
    variable in that class
    Default(it's not a keyword)
    we can access that member inside the same class inside the same package in other classes.
    public;
    when we use public access modifier with member of a class it is available throughout
    that project
    Real life use:
     99.9%%  instance field are always privet.
     99.9%%  of the time instance and static methods are public;
