what is an interface;
interface is a contract that is similar to a class but all the fields inside a class.
static final(constance)and all the methods by default are also public;
Why we should learn about the interfaces;
we can implement abstraction using interfaces;
when class are logigaly connected to each other and we want to have instance fields area also
methods as well while doing abstraction then we go witch abstract class
How  can i use interface ;
we use interface keyword instead of a class and we can start creating abstract metch

Rules:
All the fields inside an interface are public static and final.
2) no instance fields means no constructor is required.
3)No instance methods in an interface and all the methods by default are abstract.
4)when we implements the methods from the interface we use extends keyword.
5)Multiple inheritance is supported by interface in Java.
6)an interface can extend another interface.
7)variables in interface can't  be privet
========================================================================
 What is Encapsulation in Java:
Encapsulation is 4 pillar. is a mechanism that provides us security.If we use encapsulation we can have more security.
 How we should use Encapsulation:
 1)make your variables as private.
 2)Create setter and getter methods to read and write these fields
 ===============================================-----------------
basic unit to store data is a variable:
Its easy to access the value by variable name we don't need to concern about indexes
problems with variables:
1)They can only store one value at a time.
2) if we have to store more then one value using variables we have to declare
more variables.

Arrays can hold multiple values in a single variable we then use indexes to access
those values
Upside of Arrays:
1)Arrays are the fastest data structure when it comes to process the data;
2)Arrays occupy 4 times less memory than an arrayList

problem with Arrays:
1)The are fixed in size means once wi have created  an array we can't modify its size;
2)No built-in methods in arrays like add and remove findIndex

ArrayList:
add()----we use to add the element to an ArrayList


//ctrl+c---to select the complete line
// soutv---to print the last variable
//shift+end---to select all the characters starting from uour courses to the end of line
//iter--- to loop
//reiter---
